# Buff-and-Green

## Abstract

_Buff and Green_ is an implementation of a game also known as Checkers,
Draughts, Dama, Damas, Dame. If the name _Buff and Green_ is used then
this specific implementation is meant. The other names are used here
to refer to the game in more general scope. Like when discussing
specific rule variants or if the whole family of Checkers games is meant.
The _family of Checkers games_ is played on rectangular game boards
and game pieces called _checkers_. These are placed and moved on squares
representing the game board. Checkers claims to be a successor of
[Alquerque](https://github.com/OMerkel/Alquerque).
Alquerque is a medieval Spanish board game. Both, Checkers and Alquerque,
are 2-player, abstract, strategic, perfect information,
traditional board games. Due to the variants and differences in
applied rules in the family of Checkers games the rules for
Buff and Green are discussed and selected from the given variety.

## Rules

### Objective of the game

Objective of the game is to be the last player performing a valid move
according to the rules. Meaning the player being not able to move will
lose the game. This may occur when either all own checkers have been
captured by the opponent or all remaining own checkers have no valid
moves left.

Draw situations might occur.

##Game Mechanics

Players' turns alternate between players. The player controlling
dark checkers moves first in Buff and Green. A player either

* must capture opponent’s pieces if possible or
* must perform a normal non-capturing move otherwise.

Passing a turn is not allowed.
